CloudSafe
=========================================================================================================
The product that we have proposed is a password management solution (a virtual safe). 
It then takes all of clients passwords and PIN codes and stores them in a database, which is then stored on the clients device and in the server. 
This database is then secured by a user specified master password or passphrase.
This way, a client only has to remember one password: the password for the password manager 
=========================================================================================================
Currently this is still a work under progress. We want to add usefull features like cloud syncronization as wwll as some form of encription.
The application currently stores the data in a SQLite file in the \Documents\CloudSafe in a simple unencripted file.
The application also provides a UI for display and manipulation of cards.
